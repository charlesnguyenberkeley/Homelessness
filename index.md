Homelessness population in recent years in the Bay Area is increasing quicker. Regarding the “Bay Area Homelessness: A Regional View of a Regional Crisis” report that is retrieved from Bay Area Council Economic Institute at http://www.bayareaeconomy.org/report/bay-area-homelessness/, in 2017 there was an estimation of 28,200 individuals were homeless arcross the nine-county Bay Area which was based on Point-in-Time (PIT) counts. This made the Bay Area the nation's third largest population of people who have been experiencing homelessness. 

As a percentage of the overall population, the Bay Area has the fifth highest homeless concentration in the U.S., with 36 homeless individuals for every 10,000 residents, which is behind New York City (89), Los Angeles (54), Seattles/King County (53), and Boston (50). The Bay Area also provides less shelter to its homeless population than other regions. In 2017, the Bay Area sheltered about 33% of its homeless population. Between counties within the Bay Area, there is a large difference number of homeless population. For instance, Solano and Santa Clara counties have the highest unsheltered rates; San Francisco is a leader in providing permanent housing.
